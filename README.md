# SBOLTestSuite

The SBOLTestSuite contains the latest set of examples created using the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) Standard. The purpose of this respository is to provide examples to test applications encoding the SBOL standard. Additionally, this repository provides a characterization profile of the SBOL2 examples which determine the level of SBOL data model covered within the tests. 

The repository is organized into the following directories : 

```
1. Invalid : SBOL files that incorrectly encode the SBOL validation rules.
2. GenBank : A series of GenBank files
3. RDF :  A series of SBOL files encoded using RDF format. 
4. SBOL1 : SBOL files which encode the SBOL1 data model. 
5. SBOL2 : SBOL files that are compliant, complete, and adhere to best practices.
6. SBOL2_ic : SBOL files that are complete, but not compliant or follow best practices.
7. SBOL2_nc : SBOL files that are not compliant, complete, or follow best practices. 
8. SBOL2_bp : SBOL files that are compliant and complete, but do not follow best practices. 
```
